# EMCS API service guide (beta prototype)

This is a prototype service guide used for research. The API it describes is still in development.

Some content may be incomplete, or links may not work.

## API overview

The EMCS API is based on REST principles. 

The endpoints accept data in XML format, and return data in XML wrapped in JSON.

The API uses standard HTTP error response codes.

Use the EMCS API to: 

* submit movement information to the Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS)
* retrieve information about movements

## API status

This version of the EMCS API is in [the beta phase](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-beta-phase-works).
