# EMCS API service guide (discovery prototype)

## API overview

The EMCS API is based on REST principles with endpoints that return data in JSON format. It uses standard HTTP error response codes.

Use the EMCS API to: 

* submit movement information to the Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS)
* retrieve information about movements

## API status

This version of the EMCS API is in [the discovery phase](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works).

## Getting started

Whether you are new to EMCS API or migrating from an earlier version, you should:

1. Review all of this document before reviewing other documents for EMCS.
2. Check whether [Trader data](#trader-data) applies to any traders you serve - any traders impacted will need to take action.
3. Follow any steps in [Before you start](#before-you-start) that apply to you.
4. Review [Making API requests](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/guides/ctc-traders-phase4-service-guide/#making-api-requests).

### Trader data

If you work for a software house, each trader you serve must [register for HMRC Online Services and enrol for EMCS](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/gg/sign-in?continue=/business-account/&origin=EMCS-frontend) and provide you with the following:

- GB Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number
- VAT details (optional)
- Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code
- company or organisation details
- contact details

### Before you start

Before you start using EMCS API v1.0, you should:

1. Ensure that you have an HMRC [developer account](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/login) - if you do not have one, you must [register for an account](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/registration), activate it by email, and sign in.
2. Add your subscription to this API to your application.
3. Learn about the user-restricted [authentication](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/authorisation/user-restricted-endpoints) used by the API.
4. Read the [testing guide]() to check that your software is compatible with this version of the API and to learn how to test your application in the sandbox environment.


### Making API requests

Before sending any requests to EMCS API v1.0, you should ensure that you are using in your software:

- the correct URL for the environment and API version number
- the correct header contents and payload information - see [EMCS API v1.0 reference]()

## Applying for production credentials

Before you can use the production environment for EMCS API v1.0, you must:

1. Complete the [EMCS API Application for Production Credentials Checklist]() (Microsoft Word document), which involves submitting test results that are no more than 14 days old (see [testing guide]()).
2. Use your [developer account](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/login) to apply for production credentials.
