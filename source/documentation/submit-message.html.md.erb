# Submit a message for an excise movement
<%= partial 'documentation/partials/google_tag_manager_js' %>
This endpoint allows you to submit a range of updates to an excise movement. Further information about updates which can be submitted can be found in [Holding and Movements Assurance Guidance](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/holding-and-movements-assurance-guidance/hmag60300).

Use the POST endpoint [Submit a message for an excise movement](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0/oas/page#tag/Movements/operation/postMessage) to submit an update on an existing excise movement.

## Requirements

The consignor ID or consignee ID must match an excise reference number (ERN) in the bearer token that you use for API authentication. If it does not, a 403 Forbidden error will be thrown.

## Path parameters

Parameters must be entered in lowercase.
