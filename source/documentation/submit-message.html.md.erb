# Submit a message for an excise movement
<%= partial 'documentation/partials/google_tag_manager_js' %>
This endpoint allows you to submit a range of updates to an excise movement. Further information about updates which can be submitted can be found in [Holding and Movements Assurance Guidance](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/holding-and-movements-assurance-guidance/hmag60300).

Use the POST endpoint [Submit a message for an excise movement](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0/oas/page#tag/Movements/operation/postMessage) to submit an update on an existing excise movement.

## Requirements

The X-Message-Type header **must** be the same as in the message body. 

The consignor ID or consignee ID must match an excise reference number (ERN) in the bearer token that you use for API authentication. If it does not, a 403 Forbidden error will be thrown.
