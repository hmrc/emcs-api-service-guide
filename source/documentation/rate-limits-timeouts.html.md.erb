# Rate limits and timeouts

This is prototype information and is likely to change.

We limit the number of requests each application can make. This protects our service against excessive use and Denial-of-Service attacks, and also encourages you to use our APIs efficiently.

We set limits based on anticipated loads and peaks. Our standard limit is 3 requests per second per application.

If you reach this limit youâ€™ll get a response with an HTTP status of ```429``` (Too Many Requests). If a 429 response is received we recommend that your code should stop making additional API requests for a short period of time before retrying.

You can read more about rate limiting on the [developer hub](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide#rate-limiting)
