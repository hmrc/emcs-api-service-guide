# Get excise movements

This endpoint allows you to retrieve information about all movements for an excise reference number (ERN), or for all ERNs in your bearer token.

Use the GET endpoint [Get excise movements](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0/oas/page#tag/Movements/operation/getAllMovements) to retrieve the status of an existing excise movement.

## Requirements 

The consignor ID must match an excise reference number (ERN) in the bearer token that you use for API authentication. If it does not, a 403 Forbidden error will be thrown.

## Query parameters

| Parameter | Type | Details |

| ARC | String |Filter excise movements by administrative reference code (ARC)|
| LRN | String | Filter excise movements by local reference number (LRN)|
