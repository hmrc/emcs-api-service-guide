# Get excise movements

This is draft information for the prototype and is likely to change.

Use the GET endpoint [Get excise movements]() to retrieve the status of an existing excise movement.

## Filters

You can filter excise movements on:

- excise reference number (consignor ID / consignee ID). If you do not provide an excise reference number (ERN) as a query parameter, you will get a list for all ERNs in your bearer token.
- administrative reference code (ARC)
- local reference number (LRN)

## Successful response

A successful response will contain:

- a movement ID
- a consignor ID
- a local reference number (LRN)
- a status

It may also contain an administrative reference code (ARC).

### Statuses

The possible statuses contained in a successful response include:

- Accepted
- Cancelled
- Delivered
- Diverted
- Rejected
- Replaced
- e-AD / e-SAD Manually Closed
- Refused
- None
- Partially Refused
- Exporting
- Accepted for Export
- Stopped

## Note

The consignor ID or consignee ID must match an excise reference number (ERN) in the bearer token that you use for API authentication. If it does not, a 403 Forbidden error will be thrown.
