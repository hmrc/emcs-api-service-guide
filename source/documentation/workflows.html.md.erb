# Workflows
<%= partial 'documentation/partials/google_tag_manager_js' %>

This page describes the typical workflow and high level process flow for the production API.

Information on the test process can be found in the [EMCS API testing guide](/guides/emcs-api-testing-guide/).

## Typical workflow


1. The consignor [submits a draft movement](submit-draft-movement.html) (IE815) message,  and will asynchronously receive a validated e-AD (IE801) message in return to notify them that their draft movement has been accepted.

2. The consignor or consignee can call the [get excise movements endpoint](get-excise-movements.html) or [the get single excise movement endpoint](get-excise-movement.html) to retrieve the status of the excise movement.

3. Using the ‘updatedSince’ query parameter with the [get excise movements endpoint](get-excise-movements.html), consignors or consignees can filter excise movements modified after the last time they polled for messages.

4. For each updated movement that gets returned, they can then call the [get all messages for an excise movement endpoint](get-all-messages.html) and pass in the same value for its "updatedSince" query parameter to get the messages that have been received since they last polled. This service guide contains a [list of all messages it is possible to receive](get-all-messages.html#messages).

5. The consignor or consignee can use the [submit a message for an excise movement endpoint](submit-message.html) to update the movement with the following messages:
 * IE810 - Cancellation	
 * IE813 - Change of destination
 * IE818 - Report of receipt
 * IE819 - Alert or rejection of E-AD/E-SAD
 * IE837 - Explain delay to delivery
 * IE871 - Reason for shortage
6. Once the IE818 - Report of receipt has been submitted and accepted, the movement is complete.

Detailed process flow diagrams for the new RESTful API are still in development.

As the functionality of the API remains similar to the SOAP API, you should use the [process flows in the existing DDNEA documentation](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emcs-functional-stage-31-fs31-technical-specifications). 

Ignore any references to SOAP or SOAP envelopes, the new API is RESTful.
