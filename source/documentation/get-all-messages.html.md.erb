# Get all messages for an excise movement

This is prototype information and is likely to change.

Use the GET endpoint [Get all messages for an excise movement using the movement ID](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0/oas/page#tag/Movements/operation/getAllMessages) to get all messages for a specific excise movement.

## Filters

You can filter messages on:

- date range
- message type

## Successful response

A successful response will contain:

- the message ID
- the message body
- the message type

## Note

The consignor ID or consignee ID must match an excise reference number (ERN) in the bearer token that you use for API authentication. If it does not, a 403 Forbidden error will be thrown.
