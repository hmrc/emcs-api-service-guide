## Availability

The full API has been available in the production environment since July 2024.

The test API has been released and is available. More information on the testing process and test scenarios can be found in the [EMCS API testing guide](/guides/emcs-api-testing-guide/).

## Stubbed responses

To allow users to be able to rapidly test the new EMCS API, we have stubbed the back end. To act as a realistic representation of the production API, the stub provides the same validation for level 1 and level 2 validation as the production API will. It does not provide level 3 validation.

More information about the stubbed responses you can receive is available on the [testing guide](/guides/emcs-api-testing-guide/).
