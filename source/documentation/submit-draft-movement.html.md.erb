# Submit a new draft excise movement

Consignors must submit a new draft excise movement before a movement of excise goods can take place. This is also called a ‘submit draft movement’ (IE815) message, or a 'draft e-AD'.

Use the POST endpoint [Submit a new draft excise movement](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0/oas/page#tag/Movements/operation/submitMovement) to create a new excise movement. 

## Message structures

Full details of the message structure can be found in the [technical interface specification](/guides/excise-movement-control-system-api-tis/documentation/messagetypes.html).

## Request body schema

The body for this request should be an XML body that conforms to the [IE815 XML Schema](https://github.com/hmrc/excise-movement-control-system-api/blob/main/app/xsd/ie815.xsd).

## Requirements

The consignor ID must match an excise reference number (ERN) in the bearer token that you use for API authentication. If it does not, a 403 Forbidden error will be thrown.

## Responses

Full details of successful and unsuccessful responses and their schema can be found in the [API reference](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0/oas/page#tag/Movements/operation/submitMovement) on the HMRC Developer Hub.

## Validation and administrative reference code (ARC)

For level 1 and level 2 validation, you will receive an instant response.

For level 3 validation, once you have submitted a movement, you will need to poll the [Get all messages for an excise movement using the movement ID](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0/oas/page#tag/Movements/operation/getAllMessages) endpoint. You will receive one of the following:

* an E-AD/E-SAD container (IE801) message which contains the ARC
* a generic refusal (IE704) message which contains error details
