# Submit a new draft excise movement

This is prototype information and is likely to change.

Consignors must submit a new draft excise movement before a movement of excise goods can take place. This is also called a ‘submit draft movement’ (IE815) message, or a 'draft e-AD'.

Use the POST endpoint [Submit a new draft excise movement](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0/oas/page#tag/Movements/operation/submitMovement) to create a new excise movement. 

## Message structures

Full details of the message structure can be found in the [technical interface specification]().

## Request body schema

The body for this request should be an XML body that conforms to the [IE815 XML Schema](https://github.com/hmrc/excise-movement-control-system-api/blob/main/app/xsd/ie815-v16-0.xsd).

## Requirements

The consignor ID must match an excise reference number (ERN) in the bearer token that you use for API authentication. If it does not, a 403 Forbidden error will be thrown.
