# Subscribe an ERN to receive Push/Pull notifications
<%= partial 'documentation/partials/google_tag_manager_js' %>
This endpoint allows you to subscribe an ERN to receive push/pull notifications (PPN).

Use the POST endpoint [Subscribe an ERN to receive Push/Pull notifications](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0/oas/page#tag/Subscribe/operation/subscribeErn) to subscribe an ERN to receive push/pull notifications.

## Requirements

The user associated with the provided bearer token must have an enrolment that matches the ERN. If no matching enrolment is found, a 403 Forbidden error will be returned.

## Path parameters

| Parameter | Type | Details |
| -- | -- | -- |
| ern | String | The ERN to be subscribed to PPN |

## Responses

Upon a successful post, this endpoint will return the BoxID that is now associated with that ERN for PPN.
Full details of successful and unsuccessful responses and their schema can be found in the [API reference](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0/oas/page#tag/Subscribe/operation/subscribeErn) on the HMRC Developer Hub.

## Notes

- When you have already subscribed an ERN to receive Push/Pull notifications and the subscription has not expired, making the call again will return the same response: 202 (ERN accepted).
- Each ERN will need to be subscribed, even in cases where they share a BoxID, in order to receive Push/Pull notifications.
